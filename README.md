# keyword-matcher
Beat the automated application machine! 
Many job openings with a high number of applicants will use an automated 
system to scan submitted documents for keywords present in the original
posted job description. 

This is a PHP snippet (with optional html structure and SQL database schema)
for helping you match common keywords from a job word bank. It will scan both
fields and output all matches so you can implement them into your
resume or cover letter.

This repository contains files for the whole generator, just the php, just the
database schema, and just the word bank.

Users will have to input the php for database connection themselves where
indicated in the keyword-generator.php and just-php.php documents.

All constructive criticism is welcome and any suggestions appreciated!
